Veneers AI
Veneers AI is an application that allows users to upload an image and visualize it with an AI-powered veneer effect. The application provides an option to choose different veneer styles, brightness levels, and price ranges for a more personalized experience.

Features:
Upload an image to process.
Choose between multiple veneer styles and brightness levels.
View processed images with the applied veneer effect.
Options for selecting the price range of the veneer.
Technologies Used:
Backend: Flask, OpenCV, Python
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla & React)
Database: None (for image processing)
API: Flask API for image processing
Image Processing: OpenCV for applying veneer effects on images
Styling: Tailwind CSS (in React project)

Run the Flask application: python app.py
This will start the Flask server on http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Frontend (HTML & React):
If using the HTML version:

Save the HTML code in a file named index.html.

Open the file in a web browser to interact with the application.


Hereâ€™s a basic README file that you can use for your project:

How to Set Up:
Backend (Flask):
Install required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install flask flask-cors opencv-python numpy
Save the following Python code in a file named app.py:

python
Copy code
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from flask_cors import CORS
import cv2
import numpy as np
import base64

app = Flask(__name__)
CORS(app)

@app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])
def upload_image():
    try:
        file = request.files['image']
        image = cv2.imdecode(np.frombuffer(file.read(), np.uint8), cv2.IMREAD_COLOR)
        processed_image = apply_veneers(image)
        _, buffer = cv2.imencode('.jpg', processed_image)
        encoded_image = base64.b64encode(buffer).decode('utf-8')
        return jsonify({"success": True, "image": encoded_image})
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify({"success": False, "error": str(e)})

def apply_veneers(image):
    height, width, _ = image.shape
    overlay = image.copy()
    cv2.rectangle(overlay, (50, 50), (width - 50, height // 2), (255, 255, 255), -1)
    return cv2.addWeighted(overlay, 0.5, image, 0.5, 0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
Run the Flask application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
This will start the Flask server on http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Frontend (HTML & React):
If using the HTML version:

Save the HTML code in a file named index.html.
Open the file in a web browser to interact with the application.
If using the React version:

First, create a new React project:

bash
Copy code
npx create-react-app veneers-ai
cd veneers-ai
Install Tailwind CSS by following the Tailwind CSS setup guide for React.

Replace the default src/App.js with the React code provided above.

Create two components:

UploadForm.js
VeneerPreview.js
Ensure that the project is running and the Flask server is accessible on http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Start the React app:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This will start the React app on http://localhost:3000.

How to Use:
Navigate to the app in your browser.
Upload an image by selecting a file.
Choose the desired veneer style, brightness level, and price range.
Click the "Upload and Process" button.
The processed image with the applied veneer effect will be displayed below the form.
